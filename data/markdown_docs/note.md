Understanding UX/UI Design
```
```
User experience (UX) design is the process of creating products,
in this case websites that offer meaningful and relevant
experiences to users.
According to International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) , UX is defined as
```
```
User-Centered:
The primary focus is on the end-user's needs, behaviors, and
motivations.
Usability:
The product or service must be easy to use, allowing users to
accomplish their tasks efficiently and without frustration.
```
```
"User experience is a person's perceptions and
responses resulting from the use or anticipated use of a
product, system, or service."
```

**FUNDAMENTALS OF WEBSITE DESIGN**

```
EYOBED SEBRALA
```
```
User Experience (UX) Design
```
Based on the definition UX involves two key elements

```
Perceptions and Responses: Emotions, beliefs, and comfort.
```
```
Use of Product: How the product behaves and feels.
```
```
"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it
works"
```
```

Types of Website Structures

```
There are several website structures commonly used to design websites in the web
design and development industry.
```
1. **Hierarchical Structure (like a tree)**

```
Think of it like a family tree.
At the top, there’s the homepage.
From the homepage, you go to main categories (parent pages).
Inside those, you find sub-categories (child pages).
Example: On Walmart’s website , you start at the homepage → then
“Electronics” → then “Laptops.”

EYOBED SEBRALA
```
```
Unit Overview
```
```
This unit focuses on the foundational steps in designing a
website by aligning user needs, business objectives, and
content strategy. The unit begins by exploring user needs,
which includes defining user personas, conducting
research, identifying goals, and ensuring usability and
accessibility.
```
```
Next, it defines business objectives, emphasizing how a
website’s purpose should align with user needs to achieve
measurable outcomes.
```
**Grade 12 Web Design and Development**


**EYOBED SEBRALA
Understanding User Needs**

```
Creating a website that meets the needs of users requires the deep understanding of the users.
Website visitors have different backgrounds, goals, and expectations, and failing to consider these
factors can result in a poor user experience. This section focuses on identifying user personas,
conducting user research, and analyzing user needs to create functional and accessible websites.
```
**Defining User Personas**
A user persona is a fictional representation of a typical website user. It helps web designers and
developers understand their audience by summarizing key characteristics such as:

```
Users of
different age
groups interact
with websites
differently.
AGE
```
```
A user's job may determine their
needs. For example, a business
professional may need quick access
to reports, while a student may
require educational content.

```

**Usability and Accessibility in User Experience**

```
Usability and accessibility of websites are critical factors that affect user experience and
require thorough consideration when designing websites.
```
```
Usability refers to how easy and efficient a website is to use. A well-designed
site should be intuitive, with clear navigation and a logical layout.
```
```
Accessibility ensures that websites are usable by people with disabilities,
such as those who have visual or hearing impairments. This includes
providing text alternatives for images, voice navigation, and easy-to-read
fonts.
```

```

**Defining Business Objectives**

```
A well-designed website should serve both the business and its users. Before
developing a website, it is essential to define clear business objectives that
align with the needs of the target users. This section explores the purpose of
different types of websites, and how to align business goals with user
expectations.
```
**Explaining the Purpose of a Website**

```
Websites serve different purposes depending on the type of business or
individual running them. Understanding the purpose of a website helps guide
design decisions and ensures it meets its intended goals.
```

**Conducting Competitive Analysis**

```
Competitive analysis is the process of evaluating other websites in the same industry to
understand their strengths, weaknesses, and strategies. This helps businesses improve their
own websites by learning from competitors and identifying areas for growth. Conducting a
competitive analysis will enable businesses:
```
```
Recognize what makes competitors successful.
```
```
Identify weaknesses to avoid in their own website.
```
```
Discover opportunities to offer a better user experience.
```
```
Stay ahead of industry trends and customer expectations.
```

**Identifying Direct and Indirect Competitors**

```
Competitors can be broadly classified into two categories:
```
```
Direct
Competitors
```
```
Websites that offer the same or very similar products and
services to the same target audience.
```
```
Indirect
Competitors
```
```
Websites that offer a different product or service but target the
same audience or solve a similar problem.
```

**To identify competitors**

```
Search for similar businesses online using keywords related to your
```
**01.** (^) industry.
Check social media pages, online reviews, and advertisements for
**02.** (^) competitor mentions.
Look at websites that rank highly in search engine results for related
**03.** (^) products or services.


**Evaluating Website Features, Design, and Content**

```
The website features deal with the navigation to ensure whether the menu is simple and
easy to use, search functionality whether it enables users to easily find what they are
looking for, contact forms to support customers’ communication, and mobile
responsiveness whether the website works well on smartphones and tablets.
```
```
The website design is concerned with the visual appeal whether the site uses attractive
colors, images, and layouts, readability ensures whether the text is easy to read and well
organized, page load speed the time taken to load contents, and accessibility the support
the site provides to people with disabilities navigate the site easily.
```
```
The other aspect of a website is the content. This covers the concepts of quality of information
whether articles, product descriptions, and FAQs are well-written and informative, blog and
updates whether the site has a blog with recent posts, customer reviews whether testimonials and
ratings are displayed, and calls to action (CTAs) whether the site encourage users to take actions
(e.g., “Buy Now,” “Sign Up,” “Learn More”).
```

**Evaluating Website Features, Design, and Content**


**User Engagement Strategies and Areas of Improvement**

```
User engagement refers to how effectively a website captures and retains visitors.
Some of the key user engagement strategies are mentioned:
```
```
Personalization Does the website recommend products or content based on user behavior?
```
```
Interactive Features Are there quizzes, polls that enhance user experience?
```
```
Social Media Integration Can users easily share content or connect with the business on social platforms?
```
```
Customer Support Are live chat, help sections, or FAQs available?
```

**Creating Content Inventory**

```
A content inventory is a structured list of all the content elements on a website. It
helps website owners organize, evaluate, and manage their content efficiently. By
categorizing content, businesses ensure that their websites remain clear, engaging,
and easy to navigate. Having a well-planned content inventory of a website helps
in:
```
```
Understanding what content is needed and where it should be placed.
```
```
Ensuring consistency across web pages.
```
```
Identifying gaps or outdated content that needs updating.
```
```
Improving user experience by organizing information logically.
```

**Defining Different Types of Website Content**

MODULE I


**Introduction to Information Architecture**

```
Information architecture (IA) refers to the process of organizing, structuring, and labeling
content in a way that makes it easy for users to find and interact with information on a
website. It involves creating a blueprint of the website’s content, which guides the overall
design and navigation.
```
```
What is information architecture?
```
```
In simpler terms, it’s about how content is arranged and presented so that users can navigate a
website easily and intuitively.
Key Aspects of IA in Web Development
Content Organization: Grouping related
content together and determining how it
should be structured (e.g., pages, sections,
categories).
Navigation Design: Creating clear menus and
pathways so users can move through the site
smoothly.
```
```
Labeling Systems: Using consistent and
understandable names for menus, buttons,
and sections.
```
```
Search Systems: Designing how users can
search and retrieve content easily.
```

**Good information architecture ensures that:**

```
Improves user satisfaction and engagement
```
```
Reduces bounce rates and confusion
```
```
Supports business goals by guiding users to key content
```
```
Forms the foundation for effective UI and UX design
```
```
Information architecture focuses on three key components:
```
01. (^) Who they are and
what they need.
02. (^) Where, why, and
how they interact
with the content.
03. (^) What they engage
with.
user context Content


**Information architecture**


**Importance of Information Architecture**

```
Below, are some reasons why every UX Designer should learn what IA means and
how to implement it effectively.
```
```
Organization and Structure
```
```
Information Architecture
provides a framework for
organizing and structuring
information.
```
```
It helps you make sure your
designs are logically grouped
and categorized.
```
```
Hierarchy is one of the basic
principles of design, and IA
helps you achieve that.
```
```
It enables designers to
highlight key information and
arrange content based on its
relevance and importance to
users.
```
```
Content Prioritization and
Hierarchy
```
```
User-Centric Design
Information Architecture helps
designers think of their users
during the design process, by
considering how users typically
think, behave, and search for
information. Everyone has
mental models, including users,
and IA helps to make sure that
information is presented in a
way that matches the mental
models of your already
existing/target users
```

**Importance of Information Architecture**

```
Below, are some reasons why every UX Designer should learn what IA means and
how to implement it effectively.
```
```
Navigation
```
```
Information Architecture
provides a clear way to
navigate a design.
```
```
It allows users to understand
intuitively where they are in a
site and how to move between
different sections of a design.
```
```
Good site-level organization
is a key factor in search
engines’ algorithmic rankings.
```
```
Boost SEO Business Goals
```
```
Information Architecture helps
to make sure the information
presentation of your design
aligns with the goals and
objectives of the
business/firm/company.
```
```
Users can find relevant
content without confusion.
```
```
Usability is enhanced
```

**Principles of Information Architecture**

01. Hierarchy
Information is organized in a
hierarchical structure, with
categories and subcategories
that reflect the relationship
between different elements.
02. Organization
Group related content in a
logical and meaningful
way (e.g., categories,
sections)
03. Labeling
Use clear, consistent, and
familiar terms to name
pages and navigation
elements
04. Navigation
Create intuitive paths and
menus to help users move
through the content easily
and find what they are
looking for.
05. Consistency
Consistent design patterns
are maintained throughout
the site so that users can
anticipate the behavior and
location of elements.
06. Accessibility
Ensures that information is
accessible to all users,
regardless of their abilities
or devices used.


**Common IA Forms Used in Web Design**

```
These are visual tools used by designers to plan and communicate the IA during
the website or app development process.
```
```
Sitemaps
```
```
A visual or text-based map that shows the structure and hierarchy of a website.
```
```
Helps plan the overall layout and page organization
```
```
Shows how pages are connected and where they live in the structure
```
```
Assists in navigation design and content planning
```

**Sitemap**


**Wireframes**

```
A low-fidelity visual layout of a web page or screen, showing where content and
elements will appear (e.g., menus, images, text areas, buttons).
```
```
Focuses on layout, structure, and functionality
```
```
Helps designers, developers, and stakeholders agree on placement and priorities
```
```
Avoids distractions from colors or branding at early stages
```
Tools used: Balsamiq, Figma, Adobe XD, pencil & paper


**Wireframes**


**User Flows**

```
A diagram showing the path a user takes to complete a task on a website or app (e.g.,
buying a product, signing up for a newsletter). it shows the step-by-step journey of a user
through a website.
```
```
Helps identify each step a user goes through
```
```
Reveals opportunities to simplify or improve the experience
```

MODULE II


**Overview of Responsive Web Design**

```
Responsive web design (RWD) refers to designing websites to adapt to a user's device.
The goal is for a website to retain its optimal usability and appearance regardless of the
device it's displayed on.
```
**The origins of RWD**

```
Responsive web design emerged as a
concept and approach to building
websites in 2010 with web designer
Ethan Marcotte's article “Responsive
Web Design," which appeared in A
List Apart.
Ethan Marcotte
```

**Elements of Responsive Web Design**

```
Media queries that alter web designs based on a user’s device
Flexible images they have no fixed display size limitations. This versatility makes it
easier to resize images neatly.
```
```
Fluid grids/fluid layout elements that automatically rearrange columns of content to
fit different screens or browser windows
```
```
Code for flexible layouts that resize page elements to fit different screens or
browser windows
HTML is a programming language that determines the content and structure of a
webpage
CSS is a programming language that determines the design and display of HTML
elements.
```

**Device Landscape**

```
There is a solution to this ever-expanding device landscape. A responsive web design,
built with HTML and CSS, allows a website to “just work” across multiple devices and
screens. It enables the layout and capabilities of a website to respond to their
environment (screen size, input type, device capabilities).
```

**Browser support**

```
Browser support is a website's compatibility with different web browsers, ensuring it
displays and functions correctly for the widest possible audience
```
```
You Can Use, http://caniuse.com, website provide a simple interface for establishing
the browser support for each web platform feature
```

**Tools for Testing Browser/Device Compatibility**

```
The diverse digital landscape demands you to ensure that websites and applications
function seamlessly across multiple browsers, devices, and operating systems is
crucial for delivering a high-quality user experience. For this reason, browser and
device compatibility testing helps you identify issues such as layout inconsistencies,
broken functionality, or performance problems that may arise due to variations in
platforms.
```
```
Several tools are available to test browser and device compatibility. For example,
BrowserStack and LambdaTest are cloud-based platforms that provide access to a wide
range of real devices and browsers for cross-platform testing.

**CSS Frameworks**

```
CSS front-end frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that provide structure, design, and
functionality for building the layout and user interface (UI) of web applications. These
frameworks are built with CSS and sometimes include HTML and JavaScript to make the
development process faster, more consistent, and easier for developers.
```
```
CSS frameworks provide a standardized set of styles, UI components, and layout systems—
such as grid structures, buttons, forms, and typography—ensuring design consistency and
reducing development time.
```
```
Using a CSS framework allows developers to jumpstart their work without building every
element from scratch. It simplifies the implementation of responsive design, cross-browser
compatibility, and user-friendly interfaces. This enables developers to focus more on
implementing custom features and addressing the specific goals and logic of a project.
```

**Key Features of CSS Frameworks**

```
The following are key features of CSS frameworks that make them essential to consider in
web design and development.
```
```
Most CSS frameworks come with a responsive grid system that helps you create layouts that
automatically adjust to different screen sizes.
They provide pre-designed components like buttons, forms, navigation menus, cards, modals,
and more, which can be easily customized.
Many frameworks include built-in media queries that ensure your website or application is
mobile-friendly.
CSS frameworks are designed to work well across multiple browsers, helping to prevent styling
issues in different environments.
Most frameworks allow customization, letting developers modify themes, colors, or other aspects
to fit specific design requirements.
```

**Why to use CSS Frameworks?**

```
The following are some of the key reasons to use CSS frameworks in web development:
```
```
CSS frameworks significantly speed up development by providing
pre-designed elements and components that can be quickly integrated into
projects.
```
```
Speed
```
```
With standardized components and design guidelines, CSS frameworks
ensure consistency across your website or application, leading to a more
polished user experience
```
```
Consistency
```
```
Most CSS frameworks are tested to ensure they work across all modern
browsers, reducing time spent on browser compatibility issues.
```
**Cross-Browser
Compatibility**


**Why to use CSS Frameworks?**

```
The following are some of the key reasons to use CSS frameworks in web development:
```
```
CSS frameworks are designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that
your web application will adapt to various screen sizes and devices without
additional work.
```
**Responsiveness**

```
Many frameworks allow for deep customization, meaning you can adjust
```
**Flexibility** (^) the framework to suit your design needs.
CSS frameworks are best used when you need to build websites quickly, maintain consistent
design across pages, or create responsive layouts without writing all the CSS from scratch.


**Drawbacks of Using CSS Frameworks**

```
Here are some challenges you may face when relying heavily on CSS Frameworks:
```
```
Some CSS frameworks, especially larger ones like Bootstrap, can introduce
```
**Overhead** (^) unnecessary code if you don't use all of its components.
New developers may find it challenging to grasp all the concepts of a CSS
**Learning Curve** (^) framework, particularly utility-first frameworks like Tailwind.
Websites using the same CSS framework may start to look similar if
customization isn't applied. Frameworks like Bootstrap, in particular, can
result in generic-looking websites unless heavily customized.
**Lack of
Uniqueness**


**Popular CSS Frameworks**

```
There are many types of CSS frameworks with various features in the web development
industry. For example Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Sematic UI, Materialize CSS, Bulma,
Primer CSS, Foundation, Pure CSS, Blaze UI, Spectre CSS, Onsen UI, Tachyons, UI Kit,
Skeleton, and Miligram. Some of the most popular CSS frameworks are briefly presented
in Table 1-1 below.
```

**Introduction to Bootstrap**

```
Building a fully functional website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be a
daunting and time consuming task. Bootstrap not only solves this problem but also makes
the whole process easier.
```
```
Bootstrap is a CSS framework that helps us to create easy-to-use and responsive
mobile-first web pages without any hassle. It contains HTML and CSS at its core, which
means before using it understanding both of them, is important. Bootstrap is also
completely free and open source, which means that the source code is open and easily
accessible online for you to access and edit.
```
```
Bootstrap is focused on early mobile development. Mobile-first development means that
when building any web page using Bootstrap, it focuses on how it is done on mobile
devices. This method is useful as many users around the world access the internet using
their mobile phones.
```

**Activity**

Step 1: Use Chrome Developer Tools to Simulate Mobile View

1. Open Google Chrome and visit one of the selected websites.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect (or press F12).
3. Click on the Toggle Device Toolbar (Ctrl + Shift + M) to switch to mobile view.
4. Choose different mobile devices (e.g., iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21) from the dropdown menu.
5. Capture screenshots of any issues and record findings.

```
What to Observe:
```
```
Does the website automatically adjust to the mobile screen?
Are the text, buttons, and images properly aligned and readable?
Is there horizontal scrolling (a sign of poor mobile optimization)?
```

**Activity**

Step 2: Test Responsive Behavior by Resizing the Browser

1. Gradually shrink the browser window on a desktop and observe the layout changes.
2. A mobile-first website should seamlessly adjust its layout, while a non-mobile-first design may look
broken or require zooming and scrolling.

```
Example of a Good Mobile-First Design:
Text remains readable and adapts to the screen size
Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu
Images resize properly without distortion
```
```
Example of a Poor Mobile-First Design:
Content appears too small or requires zooming
Navigation menu remains large and does not adjust
Page elements overlap or get cut off
```

**Activity**

Step 3: Check Performance on Mobile Devices

1. Open Google PageSpeed Insights (https://pagespeed.web.dev/).
2. Enter the website URL and click Analyze.
3. Review the Mobile Performance Score and suggested improvements.

```
What to Look For:
A high mobile score (green) indicates a well-optimized mobile-first design.
A low score (red or yellow) may indicate large images, slow loading times, or excessive scripts,
which affect mobile usability.
```
Step 4: Compare with Desktop Version^

1. Repeat the Google PageSpeed Insights test for the desktop version.
2. Compare the performance scores.
3. If the desktop version scores higher than mobile, it suggests the website was designed desktop-first
rather than mobile-first.


**Activity**

Step 6: Document Findings and Recommendations

1. Summarize the key observations for each website.
2. Answer the following questions in a report:

```
Does the website follow the mobile-first approach? Why or why not?
What issues were identified in mobile view?
What recommendations can be made to improve the mobile experience?
```
3. Include screenshots of both mobile and desktop views, along with key insights.

**Bootstrap**


**GETTING STARTED WITH BOOTSTRAP 5**

```
Once you have installed and configured your code editor, create a project folder and
create a file with the .html extension. Bootstrap actually provides us with an HTML and
CSS coded code template, and all you have to do is copy those templates into your
editor.
```
**Getting Bootstrap Options**

```
We will explore two ways of getting Bootstrap. You can include the Bootstrap 5 link
using the content delivery network (CDN), or simply download the Bootstrap 5
website directly to your device using the package manager.
```

**CDN**

```
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers distributed across
different locations around the world. Its main purpose is to deliver files—like CSS,
JavaScript, images, videos— faster and more reliably to users.
```
**What CDN means in simple words**

```
Instead of loading Bootstrap from one main server (which might be far away and
slow), a CDN stores copies of Bootstrap on many servers around the world. When a
user loads your website, the CDN sends the file from the nearest server, making it
faster.
```

**Activity**

```
Step 1: Open your browser and go to the official Bootstrap website, https://getbootstrap.com/.
```

**Activity**

Step 2: Download the Compiled CSS and JS code to your computer


**Activity**

Step 3: Locate your Downloads Folder on your computer


**Activity**

Step 4: Extract the compressed bootstrap-5.3.3-dist file and explore the contents


**Activity**

```
Step 5: As you can see, the CSS Folder contains many files; bootstrap.min.css will be used.
```

**Activity**

```
Step 6: JS Folder also contains tons of files, bootstrap.bundle.min.js will be used
here.
```

**Activity**

**1. bootstrap.min.css**

```
This is the main CSS file of Bootstrap — but in a minified (compressed) version.
```
```
✅ What it does: Styles your website
Gives you ready-made design (buttons, cards, grid system, navbar, forms, etc.)
Makes your website responsive (mobile-friendly)
Removes extra spaces and comments to reduce file size (that’s why it’s called
“min.css”)
```
**NB**


**Activity**

```
Step 6: Copy the bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.bundle.min.js
to the respective CSS and JS Folders on your Web Project
Folder respectively.
```
```
Step 7: Open your VS Code Editor, and link bootstrap.min.css
and bootstrap.bundle.min.js files to your index.html file. You
get the index.html from
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/,
you can write your own simple html code.

**Steps: Downloading Bootstrap using Content Delivery Network (Option 2)**

```
Firstly, make sure that there is an internet connection in your computer labs to use
Content Delivery Network (CDN), and then you can copy the link or template
first and paste it into your code editor. Bootstrap uses jsDelivr
(https://www.jsdelivr.com/) as its content delivery network. JsDelivr is one of the
most popular content delivery networks for open-source projects. The content
delivery network helps to deliver web files directly from the Node Package
Manager (npm) registry and GitHub repository without any additional
configuration on the user side.
```
```
It helps to improve the time and website performance. Bootstrap CDN is a free of
cost content delivery network helps us to quickly load Bootstrap CSS, and
JavaScript libraries on projects to make projects responsive, mobile friendly, and
attractive.
```

**Bootstrap Document Structure**

```
Bootstrap is a powerful and widely-used front-end framework for creating responsive and
mobile-first websites. Its document structure is designed to simplify web development by
providing a standardized layout, pre-styled components, and utilities. At the core of a
Bootstrap document is the HTML file, which typically includes references to the Bootstrap
CSS and JavaScript files, either through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or locally
hosted files.
```
```
A basic Bootstrap document begins with a standard HTML5 doctype and includes a
properly defined `` section with meta tags for responsiveness (``). The Bootstrap CSS file
is linked in the `` to ensure consistent styling across all devices.
```

**Steps: Create Bootstrap Using CDN**

```
Step 1: Create a new index.html file in your project root. Include the tag as well for proper
responsive behavior in mobile devices. Bootstrap 5 is designed to respond to mobile
devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the basic framework. To ensure proper rendering and
zoom touch, add the following tag within the feature:
```

**Steps: Create Bootstrap Using CDN**

```
Step 2: Include Bootstrap’s
CSS and JS. Place the <link>
tag in the <head> for our
CSS, and
the <script> tag for our
JavaScript bundle (including
Popper for positioning
dropdowns,
poppers, and tooltips) before
the closing </body>.

```
● Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS can start using Bootstrap
● Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to
phones, tablets, and desktops
● Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are
part of the core framework
● Browser compatibility: Bootstrap is compatible with all
modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge,
Safari, and Opera)
```

**Create First Web Page With Bootstrap**

```
Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the
HTML5 doctype.
```
```
Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along
with the lang attribute and the correct character set:
```

2. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first

```
Bootstrap 3 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles
are part of the core framework.
```
```
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag
inside the <head> element:
```
```
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device
(which will vary depending on the device).
```
```
The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
```

**Create First Web Page With Bootstrap**

3. Containers

```
Bootstrap also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
```
```
There are two container classes to choose from:
```
1. The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
2. The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the
    viewport


Basic Bootstrap Pages

The following example shows the code for a basic Bootstrap page (with a responsive fixed width container):

**Basic Grid System with Responsive Breakpoints**

```
Bootstrap 5’s grid system is based on 12 columns. It allows you to create fluid
layouts that can change based on the screen size. In Bootstrap, mt-5 is a margin
utility class that applies a top margin (mt) of 5 units to an element.
```
```
Breakdown of mt-5:
● m → Margin (spacing outside the element)
● t → Top (applies the margin to the top of the element)
● 5 → Bootstrap’s spacing scale (higher numbers mean more space)
```

**Example Usage:**

```
<div class=”container mt-5”>
<h1>Hello ,Bootstrap for CTE Program</h1>
</div>
```
```
html
```
The container will have extra spacing at the top,

```
Bootstrap spacing classes use a scale from 0 to 5:
● mt-0 → No top margin
● mt-1 → Small margin
● mt-2 → Medium margin
● mt-3 → Larger margin
● mt-4 → Even larger margin
● mt-5 → Maximum predefined margin
```

**Container vs. Container-fluid**

```
As you can imagine, this is used to apply specific, different colors to the two containers
so that you can see how they are put on the page. Save all files and load the index.html
page on your browser. As you can see in the above output, the container has left and right
margins, whereas the container-fluid does not have margins and covers the whole width
of the page. Container margins are not of fixed width. Their width changes depending on
the viewport width. On the other hand, both containers have left and right paddings, equal
to 15px. You can see that the text “This is a container ...” does not start at the edge of the
left border, but it has some free blank space.
```
```
Note that even if you use a container, when you shrink the width of your browser
window, so that it becomes less than 576px wide, the container loses its left and right
margins and, essentially, behaves like the container-fluid.
```

**Activity adjust for different screen size**


**What are Columns?**

```
Columns are the building blocks of a Bootstrap layout.
They are used to position and arrange your content on the page.
```
Think of it like this:

👉 **Container** → holds everything

👉 **Row** → groups content

👉 **Column** → where your content actually goes


**What Can Columns Do?**

```
Columns can be changed in several ways:
```
```
● Resize (make them bigger / smaller)
```
```
● Align (move them left, right, center, top, bottom)
```
```
● Order (change which comes first or last)
```
```
● Offset (add empty space on the left)
```
```
You control this using
Bootstrap’s classes, like
```
```
col-4
col-md-6
col-lg-3
```

**How Columns Work**

flex-box

```
Bootstrap’s grid system is built using CSS flexbox.
Flexbox automatically arranges columns nicely in a row.
```
```
You can read about flexbox in this website
```
```
Because of flexbox, you can:
```
```
● stretch a column
```
```
● shrink a column
```
```
● center a column
```
```
● push it to left or right
```

**Column Alignment (Simple)**

Bootstrap lets you align columns **vertically** and **horizontally** using flexbox utilities:

Horizontal Alignment (push columns left, right, or center)

```
justify-content-start
justify-content-center
justify-content-end
```
Vertical Alignment (move columns up, down, or center)

```
align-items-start
align-items-center
align-items-end
```
```
Give height to th row
```

**Column wrapping**

```
If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra
columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.
```

**Column wrapping**

(^) Output of the 131 page code


**Column breaks**

```
In Bootstrap, a row is flexbox.
That means:
```
```
● Columns (col) try to stay on the same line
```
```
● They only move to a new line when forced
```
```
Sometimes you want to force a new line , even when there is space.
```
(^) ❓ **What does “column break” mean?
Column break = force the next column to go to a new row**
Think of it like pressing **Enter** in text.


**Column breaks**

⚠ **Why is a “hack” needed?**^

Flexbox does NOT have a direct “line break” command.

So Bootstrap uses a trick: **An empty element with width: 100%**

This fills the whole row and **pushes the next columns to the next line**.

```
Column breaks Breaking columns to a new line in flexbox requires a
small hack: add an element with width: 100% wherever you want to wrap
your columns to a new line.
```

**Column breaks example**


**Reordering**

```
Reordering means:
```
```
Changing the visual position of columns without changing the HTML code.
```
```
So the code stays the same, but the order you see on the screen changes.
```
(^) What are .order-* classes?
Bootstrap provides **order classes** like:
order-1
order-2
order-3
order-4
order-5
These numbers tell Bootstrap **which column comes first, second, etc.**
👉 Smaller number = appears first
👉 Bigger number = appears later


**_Activity_**


**Offsetting columns**

Adding empty space to the left of a column to move it to the right.

```
Think of it like pushing a box away from the left side without adding another box.
```
#### .offset-* grid classes

```
<div class="row">
<div class="col-4 offset-2 bg-primary text-white">
Offset column
</div>
</div>
```
```
What this means:
● Grid has 12 columns
```
```
● offset-2 = skip 2 empty
columns
```
```
● Then place the col-4
```

**Margin utilities**

### Margin utilities are Bootstrap classes that add space (margin) around elements.

```
Think of it like pushing a box away from the left side without adding another box.
```
#### Example

```
m-3 → margin on all sides
ms-3 → margin on left
me-3 → margin on right
me-auto → push columns away from each other by taking up available space.
```

**Standalone column**

## You can use .col-* even without a .row, just to control width.

```
Think of it like pushing a box away from the left side without adding another box.
```
#### Example

```
<div class="container">
<div class="col-6 bg-success text-white p-3">
I am half width, even without a row
</div>
</div>
```
```
What happens?
● The div is 50% wide
```
```
● It behaves like a normal block element
```
```
● It does not act like a grid column
```

**Activity**


##### Gutters

```
Gutters are the gaps between columns in a layout. They add padding for spacing and
alignment. You can adjust their size for different screen sizes
```
```
Gutters start at 1.5rem (24px) wide. This
allows us to match our grid to the padding
and margin spacers scale.
```
```
Gutters can be responsively adjusted. Use
breakpoint-specific gutter classes to modify
horizontal gutters, vertical gutters, and all
gutters.
```
```
Horizontal gutters
Use .gx-* classes to set them.
If you make gutters very wide, you may
need to add padding to the parent
container to prevent layout overflow.
```
###### Vertical gutters

```
.gy-* classes can be used to control the
vertical gutter widths. Like the horizontal
gutters, the vertical gutters can cause
some overflow below the .row at the end
of a page.
```

##### Gutters

**Horizontal gutters**

```
<div class="container overflow-hidden">
<div class="row gx-5">
<div class="col">
<div class="p-3 border bg-light">Custom column padding</div> </div>
<div class="col">
<div class="p-3 border bg-light">Custom column padding</div> </div>
</div>
</div>
```

##### Gutters

**Vertical gutters**

```

# EXAM PREP



**No gutters**

**What are gutters?**

```
Gutters are the spaces between columns in Bootstrap.
```
```
Normally, when you use columns, Bootstrap adds small gaps between them so content doesn’t
touch.
```
```
Remove all space between columns
It removes:
● The space between columns
```
```
● The padding inside columns
```
```
● The negative margins on the row
```
```
What does .g-0 mean?
<div class="row g-0">
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8">
.col-sm-6 .col-md-8

**Bootstrap Content**

means the ready-made styles Bootstrap gives you to format text and basic page

elements.It includes styles for headings, paragraphs, images, tables, figures, and

code blocks so your content looks clean and consistent.

Bootstrap Content is responsive, so it works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop

screens, and it follows accessibility rules to make content easy to read.

```
By using Bootstrap’s built-in classes, you can style and organize content quickly
without writing a lot of custom CSS.
```

**Bootstrap Content**

```
Typography in Bootstrap means using Bootstrap’s ready-made classes to style
text in a clean and consistent way.
```
```
Bootstrap provides styles for headings, paragraphs, and inline text , and utilities
to align, transform, and space text.
```
```
It includes six heading levels (h1 to h6) , which help show importance and
structure in your content.
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

**Bootstrap Content**

Display Headings

Display headings are large, bold headings used for titles, banners, or hero

sections. They are bigger than normal headings (h1–h6).

```
<h1 class="display-3">
Welcome to Our Website
</h1>
```
```
<p>
This is the main title of the page.
</p>
```
```
.display-1 to
.display-6
```

**Bootstrap Content**

What is a Lead Paragraph?

A lead paragraph is used to highlight important introductory text.

It is slightly larger and lighter than normal text.

```
<p class="lead">
Bootstrap helps you build responsive websites quickly.
</p>
<p>

**max-width: 100%** ; and **height: auto** ; to the image.

```
<div class="container mt-3">
<p>The .img-fluid class makes the image scale nicely to the parent

**Bootstrap Interactive Components**

Bootstrap 5 offers a variety of interactive components that enhance user experience. These components are
designed to be easy to integrate and use with minimal JavaScript. Each of the components relies on Bootstrap’s
JavaScript plugins for their interactivity.

You’ll need to include Bootstrap’s JavaScript and Popper.js for the following components to work properly. In
this section, we will demonstrate how to implement some of the most common web page elements using
Bootstrap 5.

These elements include accordion, navigation bars, cards, buttons, alerts.

```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>^
```

**Buttons**
Buttons are widely used for various actions such as form submission, navigation, or initiating interactions.
Bootstrap 5 offers a variety of button styles, including colors, sizes, and outlines.

```
<div class="container mt-5">
<h2>Button Examples</h2>
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-success">Success Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-danger">Danger Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-warning">Warning Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-info">Info Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-light">Light Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-dark">Dark Button</button> </div>
```

**Activity**


**Button Grid**
Group a series of buttons together on a single line or stack them in a vertical column.
Wrap a series of buttons with .btn in .btn-group.

```
<div class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic example">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
Left: Web Design and Development
</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
Middle: PC Maintenance and Networking
</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
Right: Construction Finishing Works
</button>
</div>
```
```
What is role="group"?
Meaning (Simple):
It tells belong togetherscreen readers as one group. that multiple elements
👉 Example:
● Three buttons that work together
```
● Screen reader says: **“Group of 3 buttons”** (^)
It **does NOT change appearance** , only meaning.
What is aria-label?
**Meaning (Simple):**
It gives a **name or description** to
something **that has no visible text label**.
👉 Screen readers read this out loud:
“Basic example”
So users who **cannot see the screen** still
understand what the group is for.


**Ensure correct role and provide a label**

In order for assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to convey that a series of
buttons is grouped, an appropriate role attribute needs to be provided. For button groups,
this would be role="group", while toolbars should have a role="toolbar".

In addition, groups and toolbars should be given an explicit label, as most assistive
technologies will otherwise not announce them, despite the presence of the correct role
attribute. In the examples provided here, we use aria-label, but alternatives such as aria
labelledby can also be used.

```
Outlined styles
<div class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic example">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-success">
Web Design and Development
```
</button><button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-warning"> (^)
PC Maintenance and Networking
</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger">
</button>Construction Finishing Works
</div>


**Accordion**
An accordion allows you to show and hide content panels, making it useful for
frequently asked questions (FAQs), menus, or any content that can be expanded or
collapsed.

```
An accordion is a UI element that lets
users open and close sections of content.
● Click → content opens
● Click again → content closes
● Saves space on the page
```
```
It’s called an accordion because it
expands and collapses like the musical
instrument.
```
<div class="container mt-5"> <div class="accordion" id="accordionExample"> (^)
